DESPITE HIS STRANGE DISCOVERY, HARPER SEEMS TO HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE POLICE INVESTIGATION AT THAT STAGE, AND MY INVESTIGATION OF LOCAL FILES SHOWS THAT THE ONLY ACTIVITY IN THE TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DEATH WERE LETTERS EXCHANGED BETWEEN MAISIE, ROGERS, HARPER AND WHITE. ROGERS CONTINUED TO TRY TO QUIETEN THE FUSS WHILE MAISIE, INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER PRECIOUS LIBRARY, WORKED HARD TO GET THEM ALL TO TAKE HER CONCERNS SERIOUSLY. IN THE END MAISIE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST PATIENCE AND TO HAVE COMMISSIONED HER OWN INVESTIGATION, LED BY THE FAMOUS PINKERTON DETECTIVE AGENCY. I AM NOT SURE WHY SHE CHOSE THEM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COST, BUT IT MAY HAVE RELATED TO THEIR ROGUES GALLERY, A NATIONAL DATABASE WHICH CONTAINED PHOTOS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF KNOWN AND SUSPECTED CRIMINALS. IT WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND, AND MAISIE MAY HAVE HOPED THAT IT WOULD REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF HER INTERLOPER. THE CURRENT LIBRARIAN AT THE MANSION KINDLY GAVE ME ACCESS TO MAISIE’S PRIVATE RECORDS, A SERIES OF DIARIES AND LETTERS, MANY OF THEM ENCRYPTED, THAT WERE STORED IN THE OFFICE BEHIND THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIBRARY. I AM GRADUALLY WORKING THROUGH THEM ALL, OR AT LEAST THE ONES THAT SEEM TO BE RELATED TO THIS CASE, AND WILL POST ANYTHING RELEVANT. FOR STARTERS, HERE IS THE REPORT FROM THE PINKERTONS AGENT ASSIGNED TO THE ORIGINAL ENQUIRY. I HAVEN’T HAD A CHANCE TO CRACK THE CIPHER YET SO I DON’T KNOW IF THE ROGUES GALLERY PLAYED A ROLE IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS, BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN CHECK THAT FOR ME. A QUICK INSPECTION SHOWS THAT THE LETTER FREQUENCIES MATCH THE USUAL DISTRIBUTION PRETTY CLOSELY, SUGGESTING THAT THIS WAS NOT ENCRYPTED USING A SUBSTITUTION CIPHER, SO YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CRACK IT. GOOD LUCK, HARRY
