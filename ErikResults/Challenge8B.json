    "CleanText": "My investigations of the incident have been more fruitful than I could have hoped. Pinkertons have provided clear evidence that there was a conspiracy to steal from my library, and that evidence points to my employer, or at least someone in his employment. Mr. Rogers had planned to donate the collection to the city library in order to promote his campaign for election to governor. But the books are far too valuable to give away, and it is easy to believe that he would have tried to realize some of that value for himself, especially since an election is an expensive business. In our state, there are advertisements to purchase, and influential people who need to be convinced to back him. It is my duty as the custodian of the collection to protect it. I cannot let him destroy everything we have built together. It was my hope that by gathering enough evidence to incriminate him, I could convince Mr. Rogers to leave the library alone.  I have spent years curating it, and it contains many precious items I could not bear to lose. I have shown him the letters from Pinkertons and tried to reason with him. He is very angry with me and keeps saying that the death and the attempted theft had nothing to do with him. He is right that there is nothing conclusive in the evidence, but as I pointed out to him, there does not need to be any proof. Even the suspicion of his involvement would severely damage his reputation and would destroy his chance of election.  He has threatened to fire me, but it is an empty threat. He cannot afford for me to talk to the press. Until he agrees to my demands, I will continue to harass him and build my evidence. My library must be protected at all costs.",
