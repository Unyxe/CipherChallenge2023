REPORT FOR MISS MAISIE STYLES
THE LIBRARY
OUR AGENT SHAVE COMPLETED THEIR ENQUIRIES AND ARE NOW IN A POSITION TO REPORT THEIR FINDINGS THEY ARE SUMMARISED BELOW
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS
IF YOU PREFER TO TERMINATE THE INVESTIGATION NOW THEN WE WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION SO THAT WE CAN SETTLE YOUR ACCOUNT
A
THE BODY WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD WITH BLOND HAIR AND A DISTINCTIVE SCAR ON HIS LEFT CHEEK
NO MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD REPORTED KNOWING OR HAVING ANY RECOLLECTION OF MEETING WITH HIM
B
HE CARRIED NO PAPERS SO IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY AT THAT STAGE OF THE ENQUIRY WITH ANY CERTAINTY
ALTHOUGH THE STYLE OF HIS SHOES AND THE MARQUE OF HIS POCKET WATCH WERE EUROPEAN SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS WELL TRAVELLED
C
ENQUIRIES AT THE LOCAL CARRIAGE COMPANY YIELDED THE INFORMATION THAT HE HAD ARRIVED ON A COACH FROM NEW YORK THE DAY BEFORE HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED
D
HIS IMAGE WAS NOT IN OUR ROGUES GALLERY BUT WE ADDED THE DESCRIPTION AND CIRCULATED IT TO OUR NEW YORK OFFICE
E
AIDED BY THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF THE YOUNG MANS APPEARANCE OUR AGENTS WERE ABLE TO FOLLOW HIS TRAIL BACK TO ELLIS ISLAND WHERE HE HAD ARRIVED ON THE SS PARIS A SHIP CARRYING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED PASSENGERS FROM SOUTHAMPTON ENGLAND
F
THE CABIN STAFF RECALL OUR PASSENGER AS RATHER RECLUSIVE SUFFERING FROM SICKNESS FOR MUCH OF THE VOYAGE
G
RECORDS FROM THE SHIPPING COMPANY SHOW THAT HE TRAVELLED UNDER THE NAMES TANLEY ISLES AND THAT HIS PASSAGE HAD BEEN PAID FOR BY A BOOKSHOP IN THE SMALL HAMPSHIRE VILLAGE OF ALRESFORD
H
ISLES WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BUT THE BOOKSHOP WAS OF MINOR INTEREST AS BESIDES A SMALL BUT PROFITABLE TRADE IN INCUNABULA IT WAS ALSO SUSPECTED OF TRADING IN ITEMS WITH A MORE DUBIOUS PROVENANCE
I
WE WERE UNABLE TO INVESTIGATE OUR SUBJECT FURTHER WITHOUT ALERTING THE BOOK SELLER TO OUR INTERESTS
O FOR NOW WE HAVE PAUSED THE ENQUIRY
J
IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE BOOK FOUND NEXT TO THE BODY HAD PARTICULAR VALUE OR THAT YOUR COLLECTION INCLUDES ITEMS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL BOOK SMUGGLERS
THEN IT MIGHT BE WORTH EXTENDING THE INVESTIGATION TO COVER THE BOOKSELLERS BUT THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED SO FAR IS ONLY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND THE COSTS OF FURTHER ENQUIRIES COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL
